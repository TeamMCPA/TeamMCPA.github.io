#### Richard N. Aslin
<img align="left" src="images/aslin_headshot.jpg" alt="Richard Aslin photo" width="100px" style="margin: 5px 15px 5px 0px;">
Senior Scientist at Haskins Laboratories and affiliated with the Psychology Departments at Yale and the University of Connecticut (formerly Emeritus professor and Director of the Rochester Center for Brain Imaging at the University of Rochester). He has conducted research on human infants and adults at the behavioral and neural levels for the past 40 years, including studies of statistical learning, spoken word recognition, and sensory-motor control. He led a consortium that pioneered the use of fNIRS with infants in the 2000’s and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

#### Laurie Bayet

@lauriebayet, A postdoctoral research fellow at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Rochester, and received a Ph.D. from the University of Grenoble. Her work uses behavioral methods, computational tools, EEG, and fNIRS to examine changes in visual representations unfolding from infancy to adulthood with an emphasis on face and facial emotion perception development.

@chengyu06242013, A graduate student in Computer Science. Chengyu completed bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Financial Economics at the University of Rochester. During his undergraduate education, he also worked in the Raizada Lab at the Rochester Center for Brain Imaging, developing software tools for processing fNIRS data and performing multivariate pattern analyses.

#### Lauren L. Emberson

@laurenemberson, Assistant Professor in the Psychology Department at Princeton University. Received her Ph.D. at Cornell University and was a postdoctoral research associate at University of Rochester. Her work uses fNIRS, as well as behavioral methods, to investigate perceptual development and learning in young infants. Prof. Emberson’s research consistently pushes both theoretical and methodological or technical boundaries with the ultimate goal of understanding how experience supports development. 

#### Rajeev D.S. Raizada
<img align="left" src="images/raizada_headshot.jpg" alt="Rajeev Raizada photo" width="100px" style="margin: 5px 15px 5px 0px;">
Assistant Professor in the Department of Brain & Cognitive Sciences at the University of Rochester. He works in the development of neural decoding approaches for fMRI data, with application in particular to decoding semantic information from words and sentences. In this collaboration, he is excited to be able to extend such work from fMRI to fNIRS. More information about his work can be found at [http://raizadalab.org](http://raizadalab.org).

@bzinszer, Research Associate in the BOLD Lab at the University of Delaware & in the Princeton Baby Lab. Ben was previously a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin and a postdoc at the Rochester Center for Brain Imaging (University of Rochester) in the Raizada and Rochester Baby Labs. He received his PhD in Psychology at Penn State University, studying the effects of cross-language interaction in Chinese-English bilinguals. His work explores linguistic categories, neural semantic representations, and the development of these structures in monolingual and bilingual learners. His work is available at [http://benjaminz.com](http://benjaminz.com).
