Assistant Professor in the Psychology Department at Princeton University. Received her Ph.D. at Cornell University and was a postdoctoral research associate at University of Rochester. Her work uses fNIRS, as well as behavioral methods, to investigate perceptual development and learning in young infants. Prof. Embersonâ€™s research consistently pushes both theoretical and methodological or technical boundaries with the ultimate goal of understanding how experience supports development.
